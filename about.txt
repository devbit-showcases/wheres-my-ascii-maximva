ABOUT ASCII ADVENTURE
---------------------
  ASCII ADVENTURE is a game about finding your luck, about persistance. It's about letters on tiles,
  and finding all the sets to complete the game.
  When you start playing, don't be fooled by the first level, you might come to think it's an easy game,
  easily mastered. But think again as you work your way up, things get hard, fast.


CHEATS / POWER-UPS / EASTER-EGGS
--------------------------------
  The Sims money cheat: 'ROSEBUD' would grant you in-game money to build or furnish your house:
  Type 'ROSEBUD' in the main menu and the character displayed on all tiles in the next game will be '$'.

  The KONAMI code: This cheat-code is present in most all games from KONAMI, it's a real classic:
  Typing 'UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A' in-game will briefly reveal 5 random tiles.

  The DOOM God Mode cheat: It would give the player god-like power (no damage from enemies):
  Type 'IDQD' in-game and all tiles will briefly turn around.
